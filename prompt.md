## Instructions to Create a Radio News Script

### Objective:
Transform a list of news items into a coherent, engaging radio news script.

### Duration:
The total news script should be no more or less than five minutes long.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Input Structure:**
    - The input will be a list of news items.
    - Each item will include a timestamp, headline and a brief description.
    - Optionally, some items may have additional details such as quotes or background information.{% if have_weather %}
    - The first item of the input is a weather report, it should not be read as the first item - it should be used for the weather in the sign off.{% endif %}

2. **Understanding the Audience:**
    - Assume the audience is general and diverse, similar to the listeners of a popular radio station.
    - Keep the language clear, concise, and engaging.
    - Ensure the tone is professional but accessible, with a touch of warmth and relatability.
    - Avoid gendered pronouns where possible.

3. **Script Format:**{% if is_top_of_the_hour %}
    - Your intro should include a time call, eg "And now your {{ current_hour_12 }} o'clock news."{% endif %}
    - Begin with a brief introduction that sets the stage for the news update.
    - Select major world events first, then major national events, then local where the content feed allows. Use the timestamp to decide what's most pressing.
    - Present each news item in a logical sequence. Group related items together by category or region for a smoother flow.
    - Make sure to use transitions to connect different segments.
    - If you have weather information just before you conclude give a brief weather update. Keep the weather friendly and informal. Use whole numbers for the weather information, not decimals.
    - Conclude with a closing that reinforces the station's identity.
    - Show where the news entry and exit sound effects should occur with "[SFX: NEWS INTRO]"
    - Show where the first news story starts with "[SFX: ARTICLE START]"
    - Show where story break sound effects should occur "[SFX: ARTICLE BREAK]"
    - After the last story have "[SFX: NEWS OUTRO]" immediatly before the conclusion copy.
    - Do not have an artical break SFX after the last article. Just denote the news outro.
    - Do not modify the naming of the SFX events.
    - No other script notes are needed (ie, don't highlight the news reader on each article)

4. **Stylistic Guidelines:**
    - Use active voice and present tense to make the news feel immediate and relevant.
    - Vary sentence length to maintain listener interest. Use shorter sentences for clarity and impact.
    - Vary the opening and closing but don't deviate too far from the set content.
    - Incorporate direct quotes when available to add authenticity and depth.
    - Include necessary context but avoid overly technical language or jargon.
    - Maintain a balanced tone, avoiding sensationalism while highlighting the significance of each story.
    - Do not editorialise.

5. **Voice and Pacing:**
    - Write with the natural rhythm of spoken language in mind. Read the script aloud to ensure it sounds smooth and natural.
    - Use punctuation to indicate pauses and emphasis. Ellipses (...) can suggest a brief pause, while commas and periods provide natural breaks.

6. **Sample Script Structure:**
    - **Introduction:**
        ```
        Good {{ period_of_day }}, this is {{ newsreader_name }} with your latest news update on {{ station_name }}. Here are today's top stories...
        ```
    - **News Items:**
        - **Headline:** Introduce the headline.
        - **Details:** Provide a brief description and relevant details. Include quotes if available.
        - **Transition:** Connect to the next item.
    - **Weather:**
        ```
        It's currently [current_temp] here in Sydney, and we are looking at a high of [high] tomorrow with lows around [low] and [chance_rain] chance of rain.
        ```
    - **Conclusion:**
        ```
        That’s all for now. Stay tuned to {{ station_name }} for more updates throughout the day. This is {{ newsreader_name }}, thanks for listening.
        ```

   **Description:** Weather in Sydney, Australia: Shower or two. with a 60% chance of precipitation. For tomorrow, expect a low of 12°C and a high of 19°C with Showers easing. and a 80% chance of precipitation.

2. **Headline:** Program hoping to inspire locals to enrol to vote ahead of NT elections
   **Category:** Australia
   **Description:** Australia boasts some of the highest enrolment rates in the democratic world, but getting people to show up to the ballot box is a different story.

   **Category:** Politics
   **Description:** The fruits of Labor's budget efforts are emerging, with one company already locking in a green steel plan in central Queensland, that could be up and running in years. While the budget promotion ramps up, the Opposition is targeting Labor's migration settings, saying the Liberal policy to reduce arrivals won't slow economic growth.
